# Human-Fallowing-Robot
The Human Following Robot is designed to detect and follow a moving object using a combination of ultrasonic and infrared (IR) sensors. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object, while the IR sensors detect motion. Based on the sensor inputs, the Arduino controls the motors to move the robot in the direction of the detected object.
